Here we create a new instance of Client to interact with the database and then establish communication with it via the connect() method. We then run a SQL query via the query() method. Finally, communication is closed via the end() method.

// Creates a connection to the PG DB
const client = new pg.Client(connectionString);

client.connect();
const query = client.query(
  'CREATE TABLE items(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, text VARCHAR(40) not null, complete BOOLEAN)');

// When all rows have been queried or an error occurs, then the query will end.
query.on('end', () => { client.end(); });
